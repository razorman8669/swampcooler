## A DIY swampcooler for Burning Man or other dry place

I pretty much copied the design from here https://www.instructables.com/Arobodudes-DIY-Burning-Man-Evaporative-AC-Swamp-Co/ and made a few mods and improvements. Total build is roughly an hour or so when you have the right tools:

Total cost is about $100 give or take depending on where you source your materials, and if you have extra 5 gallon buckets lying around.

In dry climates with about 90째F ambient air temperature, I was seeing 20째F+ drop in temperature coming out of this swamp cooler.  I was measuring 68째F air coming out.

### Improvements on original design
- I decided to go with an [exhaust blower](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003EX02DA) fan instead of the computer fan since it's got much more power and the added perk is it's way easier to install.  It's also water and dust proof 
- The power supply needs to be capable of running the blower fan.  I found that many cheaper power supplies would get overloaded on fan startup and fail so if you choose to find a different one than the one below, make sure you test it fully before bringing it out to the playa.
- The water pump should have `run-dry` protection to prevent it from burning out.  the OG instructions dont make mention to this, but I think it's really important, especially if you're prone to forgetting to turn things off.

### Tools:
- 2" Hole Saw
- 4" Hole Saw
- Power Drill
- Drill Bit Set

### Materials:
1. Power Supply: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BGZQXKW You need a quality power supply as I tried many other cheaper ones and it doesn't power the blower fan or triggers the overload protection and shuts off.  This one works though!
1. Blower Fan: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003EX02DA The other instructions use a computer fan, which not only requires more labor and parts to rig, but also isn't as powerful.  you want maximum power!
1. Water Pump: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TVJWCPK You need a pump that has run-dry protection, otherwise you'll be burning out your pump when the water runs dry.
1. 24"x30" Aspen Snow cooling pads from B&C True Value ($6) (or online for more $$$ https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001UTEJLQ).  These work the best IMHO.  the blue cooler pads just dont give enough surface area, and imped the airflow too much.
1. T connector: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002FYAQKI
1. 1/2" ID flex tubing https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HF4SYWY.  you could pick this up at a hardware store, or buy online.
1. 5 Gallon Bucket
1. 5 Gallon Reusable Bucket lid:  Make sure you get one that is easy to put on/take off as you'll be doing that a bunch.
1. Semi Rigid Dryer Duct - I used https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071LHCFZ8 as it was a bit more insulated than the singly layer aluminum ones, which felt better for playa.  but you could always just go the cheaper route and get the aluminum ones from the hardware store.
1. 4" Hose clamp (cheaper at hardware store, otherwise, you can buy them online https://www.amazon.com/dp/B092LFWV6H)
1. (optional) timer switch - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D3QEK4E - if you're forgetful and think you'll walk away without turning off the water pump, you might want to consider a timer switch so that it automatically turns off.  If you run the fan & water pump on the same timer, then you'll be sure that if you fall asleep, then the fan will turn off before the water all evaporates, to prevent blowing warm air into your living space.

### Instructions
1. the actual build is pretty similar to the instructions linked above, but instead of the computer fan, it uses the exhaust blower fan which is a lot easier to install (just drill a 4" hole using a hole saw and the fan slots right in.)
1. You then place the dryer duct on the other end of the fan, using the optional 
2. When installing the cooling pad into the bucket, you need to fold it at about 14" from the bottom and then place it in the bucket with the shorter side on the outside of the ring.  (Images coming later)

### A note on ICE usage in swamp cooler
The ideal temperature of the water should be between 50째F and room temperature.  Any colder, and the evaporation effect is reduced substantially.  It is true that running air over ice (or very cold water) will transfer some of that heat out of the air, however, the reduction in evaporative cooling will result in only marginal improvements.  It's just not economical nor very green to be buying ice (or making ice) and then sticking it in your swamp cooler.  Best to just stick with cool water.

That all said, a little ice could be helpful if the water that you're putting into the swamp cooler is warm in order to cool it to room temperature, but just go easy on the ice and only add a little.

### Operation
- Fill the swamp cooler up to the bottom of the holes on the sides (about 2-3 gallons).
- Make sure to use clean water and try to use room temperature water for best results.
- turn on the water pump and fan and give it a few minutes to saturate the cooler pad.
- Make sure to check for any leaks regularly!  You might need to adjust the tubing inside the swamp cooler to make sure it's not spraying out the holes.
- After a about 2 hours, the water should all be evaporated, and you should turn off the fan and water pump.  The timer switch could help with making sure it doesnt continue to run after all water is evaporated.
