## A DIY swampcooler for Burning Man or other dry place

I pretty much copied the design from here https://www.instructables.com/Arobodudes-DIY-Burning-Man-Evaporative-AC-Swamp-Co/ and made a few mods and improvements. Total build is roughly an hour or so when you have the right tools:

Total cost is about $100 give or take depending on where you source your materials, and if you have extra 5 gallon buckets lying around.

### Improvements on original design
- I decided to go with an [exhaust blower](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003EX02DA) fan instead of the computer fan since it's got much more power and the added perk is it's way easier to install.  It's also water and dust proof 
- The power supply needs to be capable of running the blower fan.  I found that many cheaper power supplies would get overloaded on fan startup and fail so if you choose to find a different one than the one below, make sure you test it fully before bringing it out to the playa.
- The water pump should have `run-dry` protection to prevent it from burning out.  the OG instructions dont make mention to this, but I think it's really important.

### Tools:
2" Hole Saw
4" Hole Saw
Power Drill
Drill Bit Set

### Materials:
1. Power Supply: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BGZQXKW You need a quality power supply as I tried many other cheaper ones and it doesn't power the blower fan or triggers the overload protection and shuts off.  This one works though!
1. Blower Fan: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003EX02DA The other instructions use a computer fan, which not only requires more labor and parts to rig, but also isn't as powerful.  you want maximum power!
1. Water Pump: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TVJWCPK You need a pump that has run-dry protection, otherwise you'll be burning out your pump when the water runs dry.
1. 24"x30" Aspen Snow cooling pads from B&C True Value ($6) (or online for more $$$ https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001UTEJLQ).  These work the best IMHO.  the blue cooler pads just dont give enough surface area, and imped the airflow too much.
1. T connector: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002FYAQKI
2. 1/2" ID flex tubing https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HF4SYWY.  you could pick this up at a hardware store, or buy online.
3. 5 Gallon Bucket
4. 5 Gallon Reusable Bucket lid:  Make sure you get one that is easy to put on/take off as you'll be doing that a bunch.
5. Semi Rigid Dryer Duct


### Instructions
1. the actual build is pretty similar to the instructions linked above, but instead of the computer fan, it uses the exhaust blower fan which is a lot easier to install (just drill a 4" hole using a hole saw and the fan slots right in.)
1. You then place the dryer duct on the other end of the fan.
2. Fold the cooling pad about 14" from the bottom and then place it in the bucket.
3.
